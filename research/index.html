  <p>My research interests are in string theory, quantum field theories, supersymmetry and mathematical physics. </p>



  <h2>Publications</h2>

A list of my publications can be found on <a href="http://inspirehep.net/search?p=author%3AA.Bourget.1">Inspires</a> or <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eUqUgLoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">Google Scholar</a>. 

<h2>Related pages</h2>

<p>I like books, I spend a significant amount of my money buying books, and a significant part of my time reading them. <a href="/research/science_books.html">Here</a> you can find a list of my favourite books, with some comments. </p>

<p>In addition to books, there are a lot of freely accessible reviews and lecture notes online. I'm not aware of any page where a list of such documents, so I have started <a href="/research/lecture_review.html">one here</a>. </p>


<h2>Strings, Cosmology and Gravity Student Conference</h2>

      <p> I am one of the organizers of this international conference that has taken place on 7-8 january, 2016 at Imperial College, London. <br/>The conference is designed to bring together young PhD and postdoctoral scientists working in theoretical high energy physics, especially in the areas of String Theory, Cosmology and Gravity.</p>

      <p> More information can be found on the <a target="_blank"  href="https://sites.google.com/site/scgsc15/">conference website</a>, and on the <a target="_blank"  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzgT5NROOVJwY0tpRTdrQWJmTDg/view">poster</a>.  </p>
