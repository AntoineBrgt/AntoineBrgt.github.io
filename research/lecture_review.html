title: Lecture notes and Reviews
permalink: /research/lecture_review.html
---

<p>This page is under construction. My idea is to put here a selection of <i>recent</i> review papers and lecture notes on specific topics I'm interested in. "Recent" is of course a relative concept, but this is why I don't include famous lecture notes like Polchinski's famous <i>Lectures on D-branes</i>, nor Intriligator and Seiberg's <i>Lectures on supersymmetric gauge theories and electric-magnetic duality</i>, although of course both are excellent. </p>



  <h3>Holography</h3>

  <ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04948">TASI lectures on AdS/CFT</a>, by Joao Penedones. The approach taken here is to consider holography as a natural, of not the only, approach to quantum gravity. Supersymmetry and string theory are avoided as much as possible -- in fact, their main advantage is that they provide explicit examples, but otherwise they are not crucial ingredients of the much more general holographic approach to gravity. </li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02967">TASI Lectures on the Higher Spin - CFT duality</a>, by Simone Giombi. The approach taken here is to consider holography as a natural, of not the only, approach to quantum gravity. Supersymmetry and string theory are avoided as much as possible -- in fact, their main advantage is that they provide explicit examples, but otherwise they are not crucial ingredients of the much more general holographic approach to gravity. </li>
<li><a href="http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2016/05/AdSCFTCourseNotesCurrentPublic.pdf">Lectures on AdS/CFT from the Bottom Up</a>, by Jared Kaplan. A good set of lecture notes, where again the word "supersymmetry" barely appears once. Free fields, and more general free theories are discussed. Large black holes in AdS are seen as CFT states. Also, conformal theories with no local stress-energy tensor are discussed.  </li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0518">Holographic duality with a view toward many-body physics</a>, by John McGreevy. The bold assertion in those lectures is that
  <ul>
<li>Some ordinary quantum field theories (QFTs) are secretly quantum theories of gravity.</li>
<li>Sometimes the gravity theory is classical, and therefore we can use it to compute interesting observables of the QFT.</li>
</ul>
Again, the emphasis here is on the non-centrality of supersymmetry to the holographic principle (see section 7.2).  </li>
