<p>This workshop is dedicated to stringy constructions of 6d superconformal field theories. The main tools are geometric engeneering, F-theory, M-theory, and brane systems.  To encourage discussion we keep a very light schedule of blackboard talks, with plenty of time left to collective research. The meeting will take place in the middle of the renowned Landes forest, see the map below. 
</p>



<h2>Social activities</h2>


<p> A visit to the vineyards of Medoc will be organized on Saturday 17, and a trip to the ocean at Lacanau on Sunday 18.
