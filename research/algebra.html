<p>We say that a ring is <i>local</i> if it has exactly one maximal ideal. The reason for that definition is the following. Let $Y$ be a variety (over the complex numbers), and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the ring of all regular functions (locally ratios os polynomials) on $Y$. We can then construct, for any point $P$ on $Y$, the ring $\mathcal{O}_P$ of <i>germs</i> near $P$: an element of $\mathcal{O}_P$ is a pair $(U,f)$ where $U$ is an open subset of $Y$ containing $P$ and $f$ is a regular function on $U$, and two pairs $(U,f)$ and $(U',f')$ are identified if $f=f'$ on $U \cap U'$. </p>
