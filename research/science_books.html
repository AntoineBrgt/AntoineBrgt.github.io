Here is a list (in construction) of some books that I have used and appreciated for my research. 


<h3>String theory</h3>

<p>Polchinski, J. (1998). <i>String theory</i>. <br>
This is one of the main reference texts on string theory. It is as complete as it could be when it was published in 1998. One thing that I particularly like is that it contains a lot of technical computations with the right amount of details, consistent notations throughout and (at least in the recent editions) few (no?) typos, which is truly remarkable.
</p>


<p>Becker, K., Becker, M., & Schwarz, J. H. (2006). <i>String theory and M-theory: A modern introduction.</i>  <br>
This is a good complement to Polchinski's book, which includes more modern topics. The presentation is lighter, with less computations and more text. It contains solved exercises, which is quite rare for a textbook at this level.
</p>



<h3>Supersymmetry and supergravity</h3>

<p>Terning, J. (2006). <i>Modern supersymmetry: Dynamics and duality.</i> Oxford University Press. <br>
This is a modern textbook (as the title says), which starts from the very beginning of supersymmetry (supersymmetric actions, MSSM) and takes the reader to recent developments (dualities, holomorphy, Seiberg-Witten theory, ...). All this is done quite efficiently, so I would recomment this book as a first approach to supersymmetry aimed at theoretical physicists. Supergravity is also mentioned, but not in great detail.
</p>

<p>Freedman, D. Z., & Van Proeyen, A. (2012). <i>Supergravity</i>. <br>
This is a standard introduction to supergravity, with all the details worked out. I consider it as the bible of supergravity.
