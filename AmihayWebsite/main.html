<h2>Research</h2>


<p>I propose new tools to study the physics of supersymmetric gauge theories.
The tools are very new and have not been addressed in the physics literature
so far. This proposal has a high risk since the physics of supersymmetric
gauge theories is fairly well understood. On the other hand, if successful,
such tools will write a new chapter in the the study of supersymmetric gauge
theories and the ongoing interaction between theoretical physics, algebraic
geometry and representation theory (as is already happens – see, for ex-
ample, the mathematical literature on Coulomb branches). The subsequent
analysis of such theories using the proposed tools will then introduce new
ways of thinking about, and understanding supersymmetric gauge theories.
The tools can be applied to any supersymmetric gauge theory, either known
as living on a D brane in string theory or not. There are many models of
supersymmetric gauge theories which are studied in the literature. As a re-
sult the study of all such theories using these tools is a long term project
and looks like a very promising innovative idea for the next five and more
years. The interaction with mathematicians is already proving to be fruitful.
Over the period of my career as a researcher, there were several topics which
demonstrated real interest with mathematicians, in areas such as algebraic
geometry and representation theory. Brane tilings, five brane webs and trop-
ical geometry, Seiberg duality and cluster algebras, and Coulomb branches of
3d N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories are examples of such close contacts
with mathematicians. My work has been influential and influenced groups of
mathematicians in their studies. I expect that the interaction with mathe-
maticians will continue to be fruitful and will generate new connections and
new topics of interest.
The new tools deal with algebraic properties of supersymmetric gauge
theories and start primarily with natural counting problems that are defined
on such theories. As such it opens a way to a new study that goes across dis-
ciplines and is addressing special properties of supersymmetric gauge theories
– their algebro-geometirc properties and their number theoretic properties.
This study is rewarding to both physics and mathematics since properties
of supersymmetric gauge theories, and in particular quiver gauge theories
becomes a new field of study in mathematics. These tools can benefit the
understanding of the physical properties of these gauge theories and play as
an important prototypical tool in analyzing supersymmetric gauge theories
and their more realistic standard model like counterparts.</p>
