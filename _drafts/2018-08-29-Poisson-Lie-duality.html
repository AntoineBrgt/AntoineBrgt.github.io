<p> Usually, when one thinks about T-duality, one refers to a duality of string theories on two target manifolds having abelian isometries (a circle, or more generally a torus). This is called <i>abelian</i> T-duality. But there also exists a non-abelian version, that we call non-abelian T-duality, or NATD.  </p>

<p> In the low-energy (supergravity) description, T-duality (abelian or not) is mediated by involved non-linear transformations of the fields. In the abelian case, it can be made manifest using Double Field Theory (DFT). In the non-abelian case, there is also a version of DFT that makes NATD manifest, and in fact implements the more general Poisson-Lie duality, as was shown by Hassler in [1]. </p>


<h2>Drinfeld Double and Manin Triples</h2>

<p>Here I follow [2]. A Drinfeld double $D$ is any Lie group such that its Lie algebra $\mathcal{D}$ can be decomposed into a pair $\mathcal{G}+\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$ of maximally isotropic subalgebras with respect to a non-degenerate invariant bilinear form on $\mathcal{D}$. Any such decomposition is called a <i>Manin triple</i>. The set $M(\mathcal{D})$ of Manin triples of $\mathcal{D}$ plays the role of the modular space of $\sigma$-models mutually connected by Poisson-Lie T-duality. There are three possible Drinfeld doubles:
<ul>
<li>Abelian doubles, where $\mathcal{G}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$ are Abelian. This corresponds to the Abelian T-duality. </li>
<li>Semi-Abelian doubles, where $\tilde{\mathcal{G}}$ is Abelian. This corresponds to the NATD. </li>
<li>Non-Abelian doubles, where both are non-Abelian. This corresponds to the Poisson-Lie T-duality. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Poisson-Lie</h2>

<p>Take a bosonic $\sigma$-model with target space $M$ governed by the action $$S = \int \mathrm{d}z \mathrm{d} \bar{z} E_{ij} \partial x^i \bar{\partial} x^j \, . $$ Assume that there is an action of a Lie group $G$ on $M$ (which does not need to be an isometry!). </p>
