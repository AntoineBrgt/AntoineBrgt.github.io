<p> Today at Benasque we had a talk by Arkady Tseytlin based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04460">paper</a> that appeared a few months ago and written in collaboration with Matteo Beccaria, dealing with partition functions of some free conformal fields. Just before that, Vasiliev presented the basics of higher-spin gauge theories, discussing in particular some aspects of holography. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01888">These notes</a> are a good summary of his talk. As we will see, the two subjects are related in many ways, and one can consult for instance the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02967">TASI lecture notes</a> by Simone Giombi on this topic. In the following, I will mainly use these three documents. </p>

<p> The basic idea of Higher-spin theory is to generalize the concept of gauge symmetry, which works with massless spin 1 fields, or coordinate invariance, which involves the metric, a massless spin 2 field. Equivalently, one can take as an initial goal the description of a consistent theory with massless fields of arbitrary (integer) spins. The first reaction of a physicist used to supersymmetric QFT is to wonder about how such a theory is allowed, since the Coleman-Mandula theorem is supposed to state that the S-matrix is necessary trivial if massless fields with spins $s>2$ are present, precisely because these fields give birth to very restrictive conservation laws. It is often the ase in physics that the assumptions of a theorem are easily forgotten : in the present case, one crucial assumption is that the QFT is defined in flat Minkowski space-time. It so happens that adding a non-zero cosmological constant, the S-matrix arguments no longer apply, and the Coleman-Mandula theorem is circumvented ! Since this is such an important fact to remember, let us recover it from a different point of view. It is relatively easy to understand higher-spin fields at the linear level, and this has been done in the late seventies by Fronsdal, among others. But extending this to the interacting level, is far from being trivial, and it appeared in the eighties that the terms in the action which are cubic in the fields need higher derivatives. But then by dimensional analysis, these higher derivatives require a dimensionful coupling constant, which was identified with the radius of the background $(A)dS$ in 1987. In fact, the interactions carry inverse powers of the cosmological constant, so they become singular in the flat space limit. Even if we didn't know about the Coleman-Mandula theorem, we would then have reached the same conclusion:  <center>Higher-spin theory requires non-zero cosmological constant. </center> This is good news, as it solves the apparent paradox, but the full power of the above statement appeared only after the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence was discovered in the late nineties : higher-spin theories are natural candidates for holography ! </p>
