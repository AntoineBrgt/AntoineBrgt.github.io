<p> The title of this post is the title of a talk given by Zohar Komargodski in 2016 for the birthday of Nathan Seiberg.  </p>

<p> Here I will focus on the part about four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal theories. The physics in a CFT is by definition independent of the scale, and therefore it should be the same in various space-times related by a conformal transformation, for instance a flat space and a sphere (think of the stereographic projection). The VEV of a conformal primary operator of charge $\Delta >0$ in flat space must vanish, since there are no scale in the theory: $$\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle_{\mathbb{R}^d} = 0 \, . $$ By the above reasoning, one would be lead to think that the same holds on the sphere. But in principle, we could have $$\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle_{\mathbb{S}^d} = R^{- \Delta} \, , $$where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. This can be seen as a mixing with the unit operator! How bad can this kind of apparent violations of the equivalence between physics on flat space and a sphere be?  </p>

<p> One can show that $\mathcal{O}$ of charge $\Delta$ can mix only with operators with charge $\Delta - 2n$ with $n$ entier positif. This is related to the renormalization scheme that is being used. In most cases, one can choose a particular scheme, such that $$\langle \mathcal{O}_{\Delta} \mathcal{O}_{\Delta '} \rangle_{\mathbb{S}^d} \sim \delta_{\Delta , \Delta '} \, , $$where the operators are inserted in the north and south poles of the sphere. But in some cases, this is not possible, or not without breaking some symmetries, like supersymmetry, and this can be interpreted as an anomaly.  </p>
