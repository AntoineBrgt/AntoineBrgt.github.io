<p>In the previous post, I have recalled that although Yang-Mills theories in dimensions $d \geq 4$ are perturbatively non-renormalizable, they can flow to interesting fixed points that</p>
<ul>
<li>Are strongly interacting (we had to take an infinite coupling limit)</li>
<li>Exhibit enhanced global symmetries, as exceptional groups $E_{N_f+1}$ in the case of $SU(2)$ with $N_f$ quarks</li>
<li>Does not have any Lagrangian description.</li>
</ul>
