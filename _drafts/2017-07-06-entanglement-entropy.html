<p>A very hot topic these days in high energy physics is entanglement entropy in quantum field theory. This mixes several old objects of study:
<ul>
  <li>Entanglement : this strange feature of quantum mechanics can be traced back to the EPR papers in 1935, which started the Bohr-EInstein debate, and are at the origin of the still unsolved questions concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics;  </li>
  <li>(Von Neumann) Entropy : this is the extension of the central concept of entropy in classical statistical mechanics, which applies to quantum systems described by a density matrix; </li>
  <li>(Relativistic) Quantum field theories : quantum systems with an uncountable number of degrees of freedom, made of quantum fields that are defined on some Lorentz invariant space-time. </li>
</ul>
In this informal blog post, I'll try to explain some aspects of entanglement entropy in quantum field theory, and I'll mention some of the recent developments. </p>

<p>I should probably start with a brief review of the density formalism. In quantum mechanics, a pure state of a system is described by a vector in a Hilbert space $|\psi\rangle$ (or more properly, a ray in the vector space, because if we multiply the vector by any complex number, the state is the same). We say that the state is pure because in principle, it is not possible to know more about the state than what is contained in the vector $|\psi\rangle$. For instance, if a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particle is in the state (the arrows denote the spin along the $z$-axis) $$|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle )$$ it does not mean that we don't know whether the spin is up or down. It just means that the particle is in a state which is a quantum superposition, and we can not say more. On the other hand, let us assume that we measure the spin along the $z$-axis, but that we don't know (or forget) the result of the measurement. In this case, the particle is in an eigenstate, so it is in the state $|\uparrow\rangle$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ or in the state $|\downarrow\rangle$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$. Assume that we repeat this a large number of times. We now have a large number of particles</p>
