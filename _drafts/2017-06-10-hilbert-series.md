Putrov : BPS spectra and 3-manifold invariants

Knot $K \in S^3$. Jones polynomial $J[K] \in \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ defined by Skein relations (...) and a normalization. It was shown by Witten that the Jones polynomial can be realized in a physical setting. For $q=e^{2 i \pi /k}$, $J = \int DA e^{i (k-2) S_{CS} [A]} Tr Pexp \int_K A$. The integral is over $SU(2)$ connections on $S^3$ quotiented by gauge transformations.
Categorfied by Khovanov homology. $\mathcal{H}[K] = \bigoplus \mathcal{H}^{ij}$ then $J[K] = \sum (-1)^i q^j dim \mathcal{H}^{ij}$. There is also a $J_n[K] \in \mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ with a path integral definition where the trace is over another representation...

Is there a similar story for closed 3-manifolds ? $Z_{SU(2)_ k}[M_3] = \int DA e^{i (k-2) S_{CS} [A]}$ where the integrql is over $SU(2)$ connections on $M_3$. In maths, this is WRT invariant. $M_3$ is built by Dehn surgery : start from a link, remove the parts of the link and replace them by solid tori twisted by Dehn twists with given integers.

Question : is $Z_{SU(2)_k}[M_3]$ a nice function of $q$? in  $\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ ?

Example : $M_3 = L(5,1) = S^3/ \mathbb{Z} _5$ (Lens space) (also realized by Dehn on the unknot with 5).

Can have the explicit expression for $Z_{SU(2)_k}[M_3]$, but it is not in $\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$.

$SU(N)_k$ CS theory on $M_3$ analytically continued to $k \in \mathbb{C}$. Equiv to 4d N=4 SYM SU(N) with $\tau = k$ on $M_3 \times \mathbb{R}^+$.
