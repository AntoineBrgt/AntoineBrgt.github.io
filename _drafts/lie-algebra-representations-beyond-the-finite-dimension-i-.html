I would like to explore the representations of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Very often, introductory courses focus on finite-dimensional representations. In this article I will go beyond this friendly zone and explore wild territories. However, the realm of representations is really big and wild, and I will restrict my focus to so-called highest-weight modules, for which there is a very rich mathematical theory. I rely heavily on the excellent book [1].</p>
<p>Before undertaking this journey, we should adopt the right language, which is the language of modules (instead of the more traditional language of representations as vector spaces, which uses matrices to represent elements in the Lie algebra, but which is less adapted to the infinite-dimensional case). So our objects of study will be $U(\mathfrak{g})$-modules. Here, $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_enveloping_algebra">universal enveloping algebra</a> of $\mathfrak{g}$ (roughly, the idea is that in $\mathfrak{g}$ the only operation which is defined a priori is the Lie bracket; in the enveloping algebra, it is legal to multiply elements of the Lie algebra, in such a way that the Lie bracket becomes simply the Lie bracket). </p>
