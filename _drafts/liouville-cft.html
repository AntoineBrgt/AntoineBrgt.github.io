<p>Today I want to talk a little bit about Liouville theory. This is a very vast subject, with ramifications in different branches of theoretical physics, and that appears under very different guises depending on the context. Usually, it is first introduced as a theory of two-dimensional gravity, as you can read on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville_field_theory">Wikipedia</a> for instance. Precisely because this is the more standard treatment, I would like to take another approach, following the very nice <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4290">review of two-dimensional CFTs</a> by Sylvain Ribault.</p>
<p>Let us then try an axiomatic approach based on the general concept of bootstrap, which means that we use symmetry assumptions and then rely only on consistency to derive knowledge about a given theory, if there is a theory that satisfies the assumptions and if these assumptions are restrictive enough to derive something interesting. For a two-dimensional CFT, the symmetry assumption is that the spectrum is a representation of $\mathfrak{V}$ the Virasoro algebra [1. or more precisely, in general, of two copies of the Virasoro algebra, one for the left-moving states and one for the right-moving states. In the $2d$ surface parametrized by $z,\bar{z}$, one is generated by operators $L_n$ acting on $z$ and the other by operators $\bar{L}_n$ acting on $\bar{z}$. We assume that the central charges for the two algebras are the same. ] with a certain central charge $c$. Let us now focus on Liouville theory, which is defined by the following assumptions :</p>
<ol>
<li>Liouville theory is a family of CFTs parametrized by $c \in \mathbb{C}$ ;</li>
<li>Each theory has a continuous spectrum where representations of $\mathfrak{V} \times \bar{\mathfrak{V}}$ have multiplicities zero or one ;</li>
<li>Liouville theory with $c&gt;1$ is unitary ;</li>
<li>The correlation functions satisfy certain regularity conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is believed that these axioms define uniquely a consistent CFT. It is traditional to define the quantities $$c=1+6Q^2 \, ,Â  \qquad Q = b + \frac{1}{b}$$ and to parametrize the conformal dimension $\Delta$ with the help of a new variable $\alpha$ defined by $$\Delta = \alpha (Q-\alpha) \, . $$ This introduces a symmetry $\alpha \leftrightarrow Q - \alpha$ that translates into the existence of a reflexion relation $$V_{\alpha} (z,\bar{z}) = R (\alpha)V_{Q - \alpha} (z,\bar{z}) $$ with a reflexion coefficient that satisfies $R (\alpha) R (Q-\alpha) = 1$. This says that $R(Q/2) = \pm 1$, and consistency of the OPE dictates that $R$ should be a certain ratio of gamma functions. However, one can rescale $R (\alpha)$ by a factor $$\mu^{Q-2\alpha}$$ where $\mu$ is an arbitrary parameter called the cosmological constant.</p>
