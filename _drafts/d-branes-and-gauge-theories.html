<p>It is by now a daily routine for a string theorist to use D-branes in order to have a geometric visualization of a gauge theory. The simplest incarnation of this relation is the maximally supersymmetric $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory in four dimensions with gauge group $SU(N)$, which is realized on the world-volume of $N$ D3-branes in type IIB string theory. But how does this exactly comes about ?</p>
<h2>Crash course on the (open) Superstring</h2>
<h4>Field content</h4>
<p>Let us start with a very fast review of superstring theory. The (matter and on-shell [2. If we want to write the off-shell action, the matter sector and the gravity sector acquire an auxiliary real scalar field in addition. ]) field content of the world-sheet theory is made of the bosonic matter fields $X^{\mu}(\sigma , \tau)$ and their supersymmetric partners $\psi^{\mu}(\sigma , \tau)$. We also include the gravity sector, made of the zwei-bein and the gravitino (on the world-sheet !), which gives $4=2^2$ bosonic degrees of freedom and $4=2^{[2/2]}\times 2$ fermionic degrees of freedom. The symmetries of the action are</p>
<ol>
<li>Supersymmetry (2 fermionic dof)</li>
<li>Weyl transformation (1 bosonic dof)</li>
<li>Super-Weyl transformation (2 fermionic dof)</li>
<li>Lorentz transformations in two dimensions (1 bosonic dof)</li>
<li>Reparametrizations (2 bosonic dof)</li>
</ol>
<p>We see that the symmetries can be used to cancel the gravitational multiplet, provided they remain symmetries of the quantum action. This is always true for symmetries 1, 4 and 5, and this is also true for the Weyl and super-Weyl symmetries in the critical dimension, which appears to be 10. So we choose to work in this critical dimension, and we will gauge away the gravity sector.</p>
<p>Now that we know the field content, we can write down the action. Since the goal of this review is not to go into the details, I will simply say that the action is just the action of a free scalar superfield in two dimensions (and this scalar is a vector in the ten-dimensional target space). As a consequence, the equations of motion for $X^{\mu}$ and $\psi^{\mu}$ are just free field equations. But we should not forget the gravity sector: although the zwei-bein and the gravitino have been gauged away, their equation of motion (which is the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor and of the supercurrent)<br />
\begin{equation}<br />
T=0 \qquad T_F = 0<br />
\end{equation}<br />
remain as constraints on the otherwise free theory, and generate symmetries.</p>
<h4>Boundary conditions</h4>
<p>But let's come back to the equations of motion for $X^{\mu}$ and $\psi^{\mu}$. While deriving them, we need to impose boundary conditions. Since the goal in this post is to introduce the D-brane actions, I will directly focus on the case where we have a $Dp$ brane in directions $0,1,\dots , p$, denoted by the index $\alpha$, where we have Neumann boundary conditions. The other directions $p+1 , \dots , 9$ are labeled by the index $i$, and correspond to Dirichlet boundary conditions.[1. Hence for the $D9$ brane, the boundary conditions are Neumann for all coordinates, which means we simply have open strings with free endpoints. ] For the fermions $\psi^{\mu}_{\pm}$ in the open string (here the index $\pm$ refers to light-cone coordinates on the world-sheet), we can impose $\psi^{\mu}_{+}(0) = \eta ' \psi^{\mu}_{-}(0)$ at one end of the string (), but then at the other endpoint, an alternative appears:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ramond boundary conditions $\psi^{\mu}_{+}(l) = \psi^{\mu}_{-}(l)$</li>
<li>Neveu-Schwarz boundary conditions $\psi^{\mu}_{+}(l) = - \psi^{\mu}_{-}(l)$</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of Poincar√© symmetry, the same boundary conditions must be chosen for all indices $\mu$.</p>
