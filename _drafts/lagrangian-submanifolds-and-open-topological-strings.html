<p>In this note I would like to explain XXX</p>
<p>First of all, what is a Lagrangian submanifold ? This concept arises naturally in classical mechanics, where the system under consideration has a phase space, which is a symplectic manifold, and a real-valued function $H$ defined on this manifold, the Hamiltonian. Combining the symplectic structure and the Hamiltonian, one constructs the Hamiltonian vector field on the phase space, which gives the evolution of the system.</p>
<p>The phase space has even dimension, let us call it $2n$. Then a Lagrangian submanifold is simply a submanifold of dimension $n$ on which the symplectic form vanishes.[1. A submanifold on which the symplectic form vanishes but which does not necessarily have the maximal dimension $n$ is called co-isotropic.] To give an example, the fiber $T^{\ast}_p M$ of the cotangent bundle $T^{\ast} M$ at point $p \in M$ is a Lagrangian submanifold, and very importantly, so is its image by the Hamiltonian flow after any specified time lapse, although this image is no longer a fiber of the form $T^{\ast}_{p'} M$ in general.[1. More can be found about this point of view <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/q/60519">here</a>. ]</p>
<p>Let us now move to Kähler geometry. Calabi-Yau manifolds are special cases of Kähler manifolds, and quoting Wikipedia,</p>
<blockquote><p>a Kähler manifold is a manifold with three mutually compatible structures: a complex structure, a Riemannian structure, and a symplectic structure.</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, it has a symplectic structure given by a symplectic 2-form $\omega$, and the concept of Lagrangian submanifold makes sense. If we want to discuss a topological sigma model in which the worldsheet is a non-compact Riemann surface (which is characterized by its genus and its number of holes), we have to specify boundary conditions, and the Lagrangian submanifolds of the target Calabi-Yau space are precisely the manifolds on which the boundaries have to be sent in order to preserve topological invariance. </p>
