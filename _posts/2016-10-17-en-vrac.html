<ul>
<li>A new paper by Luis Alvarez-Gaume, Orestis Loukas, Domenico Orlando, and Susanne Reffert called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04495">Compensating strong coupling with large charge</a> appeared today. In one sentence, they prove that if you consider a QFT with global symmetries and focus on the sector of the Hilbert space where states have large global charge, then
<ol>
<li>There are Goldstone excitations in $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{eff}}$</li>
<li>The effective couplings are suppressed by powers of the global charge (and therefore are small if the global charge is large).</li>
</ol>
<p>The QFT considered here are not necessarily relativistic (a relativistic theory has to be treated as a non-relativistic one if the vacuum breaks time translation symmetry), and a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.5212v2.pdf">generalization</a> of the well-known Goldstone theorem is needed.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">In a series of talks in 2005, Vafa introduced the concept of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509212">Swampland</a>, which is the region around the string theory landscape made of consistent-looking semiclassical effective field theories, which are actually inconsistent. It is important to find criteria that can exclude a theory from the consistent landscape and push it back into the swampland. One such criterion is the following:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Gravity is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0601001v2.pdf">weakest force</a>.</strong></p>
<p>This is called the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), and it states more precisely that there exist a particle such that $m \leq |Q|$, where $Q$ is the charge in suitable units. Recently, Ooguri and Vafa applied the same idea to branes, and conjecture that</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The inequality is saturated   iff   States are BPS</p>
<p>This seemingly innocuous generalization of WGC <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.01533v1.pdf">implies</a> that non-supersymmetric AdS vacua supported by fluxes must be unstable and that their effective theories belong to the swampland, even if theymay look consistent!<br />
In the same vein, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.04564v1.pdf">Vacua Morghulis</a> incantation goes even further and asserts that non-supersymmetric vacua in string theory are at most metastable and eventually decay, while supersymmetric vacua are only marginally stable. Note however that some people think <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09289">otherwise</a>.</li>
<li>La médaille d'or du CNRS a été décernée récemment à Claire Voisin pour ses travaux en géométrie algébrique. J'y reviendrai prochainement, mais je signale déjà les bons articles de vulgarisation parus sur Images des Mathématiques, <a href="http://images.math.cnrs.fr/Claire-Voisin-et-la-topologie-des-varietes-algebriques.html">ici</a> et <a href="http://images.math.cnrs.fr/Une-correspondance-algebrique.html">là</a>.</li>
