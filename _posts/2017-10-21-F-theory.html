<p> Consider type IIB superstring theory. We learn at school that the possible D-branes in this theory will have an odd number os space-like dimensions. Here I want to focus on the D7 brane. One particular feature is that the transverse space is two-dimensional, and because of this low dimensionality, the effect of the presence of a D7 can be felt at large distance. We can see this under two viewpoints : the electric potential sourced by the brane, and the metric retroaction (being a BPS object, these two aspects are related for the D7 brane). In both cases, the behavior at large distance is controlled by the Green function of the transverse Laplace operator, which in two dimensions is a logarithm of the distance to the brane. Because of that, one can compute that a D7 creates a deficit angle at large distance, and it turns out this angle is $\pi /6$. </p>

<p> This somewhat describes the metric around a D7. To have a complete picture, we also need to describe the dilaton, and also the RR scalar $C_0$, which couples magnetically to the D7. As usual, we combine these two fields in one complex $\tau = C_0 + i e^{- \phi}$. This is a function of the complex coordinate $z=x^8 + i x^9$, if the D7 extends along directions from $0$ to $7$. One can show that the equations of motion are solved if $\tau (z)$ is a holomorphic function! But not every function will do the job... </p>

<p> One obvious constraint is that the inaginary part of $\tau$, which is $e^{- \phi}$, should always be $>0$. Another constraint come from the fact that the D7 is magnetically charged under $C_0$, with charge $1$ by definition. This means that $$\int_{S^1} \mathrm{d} C_0 =1 \, , $$ where the circle of integration encircles the brane. This implies that when going around the brane, $\tau \rightarrow \tau + 1$. The function $\tau (z)$ can not be single-valued. But recall that type IIB string has a full $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry, so in fact we should see $\tau (z)$ as an equivalence class of complex numbers in the upper-half plane under this group. It is now time to introduce once more the $j$ function, which precisely establishes a bijection between these equivalence classes and the complex numbers. So one can consider, for instance, $$\tau (z) = j^{-1}(\alpha z)$$ where $\alpha$ is a constant.  </p>
