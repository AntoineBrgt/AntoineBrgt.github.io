<p> Three-dimensional mirror symmetry is the statement that some $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories at non-trivial IR renormalization group fixed point can have a dual description that satisfies some characteristic properties. Namely, this mirror symmetry relates two $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ theories, in such a way that
<ul>
<li> The Higgs and Coulomb branches are exchanged by mirror symmetry;
<li> Quantum effects in one theory arise classically in the other, and visa-versa;
<li> The equality of the global symmetries at the IR fixed points may involve the appearance of a hidden symmetry.
</ul>
 </p>

 <p>This beautiful duality was uncovered around the year 1996. One of the first papers on the topic is the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9607207"> Intriligator-Seiberg article</a>, where the duality is illustrated with the Kronheimer quiver theories based on simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. I wrote a short <a href="{{site.file_path}}/3dMirror.pdf">summary</a> of this paper, which adds some details to the above introductory paragraph.  </p>
